Protobuf for PHP
================

Protobuf for PHP is an implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers for the PHP
language, supporting its binary data serialization and including a `protoc` 
plugin to generate PHP classes from .proto files.

Great effort has been put into generating PHP files that include all sort of type
hints to aide IDE's with autocompletion. Therefore, it can not only be used to
communicate with Protocol Buffers services but also as a generation tool for 
_data objects_ no matter what the final serialization is.

For more information see the included man pages.


## Requirements

  - PHP 5.3  
  - Pear's Console_CommandLine (for the protoc wrapper tool)
  - Google's `protoc` compiler version 2.3 or above


## Features

### Working

  - Standard types (numbers, string, enums, messages, etc)
  - Pluggable serialization backends (codecs)
    - Standard Binary serialization
    - Standard TextFormat (serialization only)
    - JSON
    - ProtoJson with _HashTag_ variant
    - ProtoJson with _Indexed_ variant
  - Protoc compiler plugin to generate the PHP classes
  - Extensions
  - Unknown fields
  - Packed fields
  - Reflection

### Upcoming

  - Pear package
  - XML serialization codec
  - Improve binary codec speed and memory usage

### Future

  - Lazy-loading of nested messages
  - Speed optimized code generation mode
  - Support numbers beyond PHP's native limits
  - Service stubs


## Example usage

	$person = new Tutorial\Person();
	$person->name = 'DrSlump';
	$person->setId(12);
	
	$book = new Tutorial\AddressBook();
	$book->addPerson($person);
	
	// Use default codec
	$data = $book->serialize();
	
	// Use custom codec
	$codec = new \DrSlump\Protobuf\Codec\Binary();
	$data = $codec->encode($book);
	// ... or ...
	$data = $book->serialize($codec);
	
	
## Generating PHP classes

The generation tool is designed to be run as a `protoc` plugin, thus it should
work with any proto file supported by the official compiler.

	protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-php --php_out=./build tutorial.proto
	
To make use of non-standard options in your proto files (like `php.namespace`) you'll
have to import the `php.proto` file included with the library. It's location will 
depend on where you've installed this library.

	protoc -I=./Protobuf-PHP/library/DrSlump/Protobuf/Compiler/protos \
	       --plugin=protoc-gen-php --php_out=./build tutorial.proto
	
In order to make your life easier, the supplied protoc plugin offers an additional
execution mode, where it acts as a wrapper for the `protoc` invocation. It will
automatically include the `php.proto` path so that you don't need to worry about it.

	protoc-gen-php -o ./build tutorial.proto
