Pinq - PHP Integrated Queries
=============================

A LINQ inspired DSL to query data structures.


    $json = file_get_contents('http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=cool');
    $data = json_decode($json);

    $p = pinq($data->results)
         ->concat($data->results)
         ->where('text', 'match', '/cool/')
         ->order(function($a,$b){
                    $a = strtotime($a->created_at);
                    $b = strtotime($b->created_at);
                    return $a - $b;
           })
         ->distinct('id')
         ->limit(0, 10)
         ->select('id', 'from_user', 'text', 'created_at');
